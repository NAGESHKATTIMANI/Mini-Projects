# IP API Project

This mini project demonstrates how to use an **IP Geolocation API** to fetch location details based on an IP address.  
It’s a practice project for working with external APIs and parsing JSON data in Python.

## 📌 Features
- Accepts an IP address as input (or can be hardcoded for testing)
- Fetches geolocation data using an IP API
- Extracts and displays:
  - City
  - Region/State
  - Country
  - ISP (Internet Service Provider)
  - Latitude & Longitude
- Handles invalid or unreachable IP addresses gracefully

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `requests` for API calls, JSON for parsing
